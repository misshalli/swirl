| Whenever you're working with a new
| dataset, the first thing you should do
| is look at it! What is the format of the
| data? What are the dimensions? What are
| the variable names? How are the
| variables stored? Are there missing
| data? Are there any flaws in the data?

...

  |=                                |   4%

| This lesson will teach you how to answer
| these questions and more using R's
| built-in functions. We'll be using a
| dataset constructed from the United
| States Department of Agriculture's
| PLANTS Database
| (http://plants.usda.gov/adv_search.html).

...

  |===                              |   8%

| I've stored the data for you in a
| variable called plants. Type ls() to
| list the variables in your workspace,
| among which should be plants.

| You're the best!

  |====                             |  12%

| Let's begin by checking the class of the
| plants variable with class(plants). This
| will give us a clue as to the overall
| structure of the data.

> class(plants)
[1] "data.frame"

| You got it right!

  |=====                            |  16%

| It's very common for data to be stored
| in a data frame. It is the default class
| for data read into R using functions
| like read.csv() and read.table(), which
| you'll learn about in another lesson.

...

  |=======                          |  20%

| Since the dataset is stored in a data
| frame, we know it is rectangular. In
| other words, it has two dimensions (rows
| and columns) and fits neatly into a
| table or spreadsheet. Use dim(plants) to
| see exactly how many rows and columns
| we're dealing with.

> dim(plants)
[1] 5166   10

| Nice work!

  |========                         |  24%

| The first number you see (5166) is the
| number of rows (observations) and the
| second number (10) is the number of
| columns (variables).

...

  |=========                        |  28%

| You can also use nrow(plants) to see
| only the number of rows. Try it out.

> nrow(plants)
[1] 5166

| Keep working like that and you'll get
| there!

  |===========                      |  32%

| ... And ncol(plants) to see only the
| number of columns.

> ncol(plants)
[1] 10

| That's correct!

  |============                     |  36%

| If you are curious as to how much space
| the dataset is occupying in memory, you
| can use object.size(plants).

> object..size(plants)
Error: could not find function "object..size"
> object.size(plants)
644232 bytes

| Perseverance, that's the answer.

  |=============                    |  40%

| Now that we have a sense of the shape
| and size of the dataset, let's get a
| feel for what's inside. names(plants)
| will return a character vector of column
| (i.e. variable) names. Give it a shot.

> names(plants)
 [1] "Scientific_Name"     
 [2] "Duration"            
 [3] "Active_Growth_Period"
 [4] "Foliage_Color"       
 [5] "pH_Min"              
 [6] "pH_Max"

 [8] "Precip_Max"          
 [9] "Shade_Tolerance"     
[10] "Temp_Min_F"          

| You are amazing!

  |===============                  |  44%

| We've applied fairly descriptive
| variable names to this dataset, but that
| won't always be the case. A logical next
| step is to peek at the actual data.
| However, our dataset contains over 5000
| observations (rows), so it's impractical
| to view the whole thing all at once.

...

| The head() function allows you to
| preview the top of the dataset. Give it
| a try with only one argument.

| Take a minute to look through and
| understand the the output above. Each
| row is labeled with the observation
| number and each column with the variable
| name. Your screen is probably not wide
| enough to view all 10 columns
| side-by-side, in which case R displays
| as many columns as it can on each line
| before continuing on the next.

  |==================               |  56%

| By default, head() shows you the first
| six rows of the data. You can alter this
| behavior by passing as a second argument
| the number of rows you'd like to view.

| of plants.

| summary() provides different output for
| each variable, depending on its class.
| For numeric data such as Precip_Min,
| summary() displays the minimum, 1st
| quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile,
| and maximum. These values help us
| understand how the data are distributed.

...

  |========================         |  72%

| For categorical variables (called
| 'factor' variables in R), summary()
| displays the number of times each value
| (or 'level') occurs in the data. For
| example, each value of Scientific_Name
| only appears once, since it is unique to
| a specific plant. In contrast, the
| summary for Duration (also a factor
| variable) tells us that our dataset
| contains 3031 Perennial plants, 682
| Annual plants, etc.

...

  |=========================        |  76%

| You can see that R truncated the summary
| for Active_Growth_Period by including a
| catch-all category called 'Other'. Since
| it is a categorical/factor variable, we
| can see how many times each value
| actually occurs in the data with
| table(plants$Active_Growth_Period).

| Each of the functions we've introduced
| so far has its place in helping you to
| better understand the structure of your
| data. However, we've left the best for
| last....

| Perhaps the most useful and concise
| function for understanding the
| *str*ucture of your data is str(). Give
| it a try now.

'data.frame':    5166 obs. of  10 variables:

 $ Duration            : Factor w/ 8 levels "Annual","Annual, Biennial",..: NA 4 NA 7 7 NA 1 NA 7 7 ...

| All that hard work is paying off!

  |=============================    |  88%

| The beauty of str() is that it combines
| many of the features of the other
| functions you've already seen, all in a
| concise and readable format. At the very
| top, it tells us that the class of
| plants is 'data.frame' and that it has
| 5166 observations and 10 variables. It
| then gives us the name and class of each
| variable, as well as a preview of its
| contents.

...

  |==============================   |  92%

| str() is actually a very general
| function that you can use on most
| objects in R. Any time you want to
| understand the structure of something (a
| dataset, function, etc.), str() is a
| good place to start.

| In this lesson, you learned how to get a
| feel for the structure and contents of a
| new dataset using a collection of simple
| and useful functions. Taking the time to
| do this upfront can save you time and
| frustration later on in your analysis.
